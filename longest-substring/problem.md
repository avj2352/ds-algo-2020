# Problem 1:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest sub-string without repeating characters.

## Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


## Example 1:
 
- Input: s = "abcabcbb"
- Output: 3
- Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

## Example 2:
-Input: s = "pwwkew"
- Output: 3
- Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
- Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
