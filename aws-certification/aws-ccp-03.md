# Technology Overview

## Organizations & Accounts

### Organizations

Organizations allow you to centrally manage billing, compliance, control access, security & share resources across your AWS accounts.

- Billing
- Compliance
- Control Access
- Security
- Share resources

### Organization Units

Group of AWS account within an Organization which contain other organizations - creating an hierarchy.

### Root Account User

Its a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all services & resources in AWS account. Every account has a Root-account user.

### Service Control Policies

Gives central control over the allowed permission across all your AWS accounts in your organization, ensuring all your accounts stay within the organization's guidelines.

## AWS Networking

AWS Networking takes a recap of AWS Global Infrastructure (aws-ccp-02.md / aws-ccp-02.pdf)

| Name                        | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Region                      | Geographical Location of your network                        |
| AZ                          | Availability Zone - Data center of your AWS resources (us-east-1a) |
| VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) | Logically isolated section in your AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources |
| Internet Gateway (IGW)      | Enables access to the internet                               |
| Route Tables                | Determine network traffic from where your subnets are redirected |
| NACLs                       | Network Access Control List - Acts as firewall :fire: at Subnet levels |
| Security Group              | Acts as firewall :fire: at Instance levels                   |
| Subnets                     | Logically partitioning of an IP Network, into smaller network segments (Eg: Public, Private subnet) |

### VPCs

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

- *Amazon VPC is the networking layer for Amazon EC2.* 

You can create, access, and manage your VPCs using any of the following interfaces:

- **AWS Management Console** — Provides a web interface that you can use to access your VPCs.
- **AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)** — Provides commands for a broad set of AWS services, including Amazon VPC, and is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux, see [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
- **AWS SDKs** — Provides language-specific APIs and takes care of many of the connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling, see [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).
- **Query API** — Provides low-level API actions that you call using HTTPS requests. Using the Query API is the most direct way to access Amazon VPC, see the [Amazon EC2 API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/).



## Database Services

The following is a list of 8 Database services offered by AWS -

| Database          | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DynamoDB          | NoSQL key/value database (eg: **Cassandra / Firebase**)      |
| DocumentDB        | NoSQL Document database that is **MongoDB** compatible       |
| RDS               | Relational Database Service that supports multiple engines (Engines - **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Maria DB, Oracle, Microsoft SQL server, Aurora**) |
| Aurora            | **MySQL** (5x faster) & **PostgreSQL** (3x faster) database fully managed Relational Database - greater performance. Also more expensive. Enterprise level. |
| Aurora Serverless | Database that only runs when you need it - just like AWS Lambda services. Most in-expensive RDS |
| Neptune           | Managed Graph Database                                       |
| Redshift          | Columnar Database, Petabyte warehouse (1000 TB = 1 PB !!)    |
| Elasticache       | **Redis** or **Memcached** database. Used for Caching solutions. Open-source |
