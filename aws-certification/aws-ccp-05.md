**PLEASE NOTE**: When taking an online proctored exam, we strongly recommend using a personal computer (not issued from your employer) and a wired, ethernet connection. The two most frequent causes of technical issues with online proctored exams are testing on (1) a work computer and (2) an unreliable internet connection. Firewalls or security settings from work computers may restrict the software from operating properly. Unreliable internet connections (wireless network, VPN, mobile hotspot) may lead to being disconnected.

Dear AWS Candidate, 

**Reminder: Your exam is in 3 days**

## Your action is required before exam day

Here’s where you come in. Before the exam, your responsibilities include reading all exam policies and FAQs, as well as ensuring your computer, internet connection, and the room that you'll use when testing meet all the requirements. If any of these don't meet our requirements and cause a problem during the exam, you'll have to reschedule at your own cost. We don't want that to happen, so please visit [this page](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue) to complete the following steps using the same computer, internet connection, and room that you'll use to take the exam: 

1. Run the [**System Test**](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue)[ ](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue)prior to your exam to minimize the risk of technical issues you may experience. The system test should be run even if you have previously taken an online proctored exam. (This is because the online proctoring software is updated regularly.) Be sure to run it on the same network and computer you will use on exam day.

2. Review the [**OnVUE technical requirements**](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue?ot=collapse7) drop-down menu to ensure your system is compatible with the online proctoring software. 

3. Review the [**Pearson VUE policies and procedures**](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue?ot=collapse541)[**,** ](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue#additional-information)[**Frequently asked questions**](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue?ot=collapse544)[**,**](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue#additional-information)[ ](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue#additional-information)and the[ ](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue#additional-information)[**Additional policies**](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue?ot=collapse23)[ ](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue?ot=collapse23)[**and FAQs for AWS**](https://home.pearsonvue.com/aws/onvue?ot=collapse23) drop-down sections. These sections cover how to prepare your workspace, what is and is not allowed on test day, and how to access technical support.

4. Note these troubleshooting tips that can resolve most issues:
   1. Chat with [OnVUE technical support](https://home.pearsonvue.com/onvuehelp) if you have an issue during or after exam check-in.
   2. Try a different computer, such as a personal computer, instead of a work computer.
   3. Close all applications before opening the OnVUE application, including your internet browser, and disable application updates.
   4. Disconnect from your VPN.
   5. Switch from Wi-Fi to a wired connection via ethernet cable. 
   6. Do not take the exam while on a mobile hotspot. 
   7. If testing from home, have others in the household disconnect from the internet during your exam.
   8. Restart the OnVUE application via your downloads folder and ask Pearson VUE support to resume your exam.
   9. Confirm your browser and operating system meet the OnVUE technical requirements.
   10. Make sure you are in your exam appointment window (from 30 minutes before to 15 minutes after your appointment start time).

_Benjamin Franklin once said, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." It’s in this spirit that we recommend you take the time to complete the steps above before you take your exam. And remember, if you still have difficulties with online remote proctoring, feel free to schedule an exam at one of our testing centers._
